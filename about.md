Hi, I'm Sven Sporer and I live in Vienna, the beautiful capital of Austria. I have a masters degree in Information Management & Computer Security. Currently, I work as a Oracle and PostgreSQL DBA[^1].

I'm interested in everything related to web technology, photography, design and beautiful code. You can also find me at these places:

* [intothespirit.com](http://intothespirit.com), my portfolio site
* [svensporer.net](http://svensporer.net), my vcard site


This website
------------

This site [txt.intothespirit.com]({{ site.url }}) features articles mainly about the web and technology. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and transforms plain text files written in Markdown into beautiful HTML. The post [Theme Setup]({{ site.url }}/theme-setup/) shows all the details.

If you have any questions about one of my projects, or just want to say hi!, just mail me at <a href="mailto:hi@intothespirit.com" class="mail">hi@intothespirit.com</a>.



[^1]: Database Administrator; however, my focus is everything around the database, using Ruby/Bash to automate as much as possible, bootstrapping with [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com)/[Foreman](http://theforeman.org), testing with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org)/[Cucumber](http://cukes.info)/[RSpec](http://rspec.info), etc.
