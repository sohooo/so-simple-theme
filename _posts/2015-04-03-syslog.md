Logfiles are scattered around everywhere. It's tedious to track them down when you just want to know the status of your backup job. You have to think about where to put them when writing your helpful little scripts. And they need to be tamed with [logrotate](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html) or a similar tool so they don't explode in size.

# Log all the things

Is there a better way? Of course there is. Just put this line somewhere on the top of your next shell script:

{% highlight bash %}
exec 1> >(logger -s -t $(basename $0)) 2>&1
{% endhighlight %}

This command ensures that everything from now on gets logged __both__ to your terminal __and__ to [syslog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog), labeled with the script's filename. Quite handy if you ask me! See for yourself:

{% highlight bash %}
% cat logger_test
#!/bin/bash

exec 1> >(logger -s -t $(basename $0)) 2>&1

echo "hi, how are you?"
echo "this goes to stderr" >&2
date
echo "funky stuff"
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if you run this script, you'll get the output __both__ to the terminal due to the `logger -s` flag[^1]:

{% highlight bash %}
% ./logger_test
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: hi, how are you?
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: this goes to stderr
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: Fr  3 Apr 2015 20:36:10 CEST
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: funky stuff
{% endhighlight %}

... __and__ to the central syslog:

{% highlight bash %}
% cat /var/log/system.log | grep logger_test
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633]: hi, how are you?
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633]: this goes to stderr
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633]: Fr  3 Apr 2015 20:36:10 CEST
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633]: funky stuff
{% endhighlight %}


# syslog on OS X

If you don't know syslog, here's the gist of it:

> syslog is a widely used standard for message logging. It permits separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Computer system designers can use syslog for system management and security auditing as well as general informational, analysis, and debugging messages.

There are many implementations of syslog for different operating systems. Most of those provide the commandline utility `logger`, which we used above to send messages to the central logging facility. On OS X, [aslmanager](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/aslmanager.8.html)[^2] manages rotated files and ASL data written by syslogd.

The manpage indicates that `/etc/asl.conf` is the configuration file for syslogd and aslmanager. Let's look at the settings for `system.log`:

{% highlight bash %}
% cat /etc/asl.conf
# ...
# save everything from emergency to notice
? [<= Level notice] store
# ...
# Rules for /var/log/system.log
> system.log mode=0640 format=bsd rotate=seq compress file_max=5M all_max=50M
? [= Sender kernel] file system.log
? [<= Level notice] file system.log
...
{% endhighlight %}

We learn a couple of things:

- `system.log` is rotated and compressed, ensuring that it doesn't get to big
- messages smaller or equal to `notice` are being logged to `system.log`; higher levels are ignored
- _Table 2. Syslog Message Severities_ in [RFC 5424: The Syslog Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1) shows that `INFO` and `DEBUG` are therefore not stored by ASL


## syslog querying

The `syslog` commandline tool offers a couple of nice features compared to the logfile `/var/log/system.log`. First of all, you can filter the log messages by _Facility_. Our `logger -t` flag sets the Facility to the script's filename `logger_test`:

{% highlight bash %}
% syslog -k Sender logger_test
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: hi, how are you?
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: this goes to stderr
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: Fr  3 Apr 2015 20:36:10 CEST
Apr  3 20:36:10 aiur logger_test[13633] <Notice>: funky stuff
{% endhighlight %}

But the `syslog` tool has some pretty nice tricks up its sleeve when it comes to filtering. [The manpage](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/syslog.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/syslog) shows more complex search expressions:

{% highlight bash %}
# find all messages sent by portmap in the last 2 hours
syslog -k Sender portmap -k Time ge -2h
{% endhighlight %}


# Conclusion

By using the syslog facility, we don't have to take care of individual logfiles for each little script we write. In turn, we have central place to query for log messages, with nice filter expressions at our hand.

With a lot of nice things, __there's also a catch__ here: as you saw above, all messages are saved with log level `Notice`, so no distinction made between `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. If you want to differentiate, you've got to use `logger -p <PRIORITY>` for each message.


# Further resources

For a full dive into the topic of logging, here are a couple of handy resources to know about:

- [log4sh](https://sites.google.com/a/forestent.com/projects/log4sh), very similar to the [logging services](http://logging.apache.org/) from the Apache Software Foundation, which means that it comes with different loggers, levels and appenders.
- [syslog-ng](https://syslog-ng.org), _Open Source log management solution with over a million global users, an enhanced syslog daemon: the Babel fish of event processing_; the next generation of centralized logging
- [logstash](http://logstash.net), another awesome centralized logging service. _You can use it to collect logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking of searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling into all of your logs._
